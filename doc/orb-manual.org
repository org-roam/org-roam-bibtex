This manual is work in progress and is not complete.  For basic commands see
[[file:../README.md]].

The following sections use Emacs Lisp examples to configure Org Roam BibTeX. If
you are not comfortable with Lisp yet, remember you can always use the
Customize interface to achieve the same, run =M-x customize= or from menu click
=Options -> Customize Emacs -> Top Level Customization Group= and search for
=org-roam-bibtex=.

* Org Roam BibTeX - BibTeX aware capture template expansion
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-roam-bibtex---bibtex-aware-capture-template-expansion
:END:
** =orb-templates=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orb-templates
:END:
This variable specifies the templates to use when creating a new
bibliographical note. It builds on the syntax of
=org-roam-capture-templates= (which, in turn, is powered by
=org-capture-templates=) by allowing you to expand predefined variables
with values of BibTeX fields.

See =orb-edit-notes= and
[[#orb-preformat-keywords][=orb-preformat-keywords=]] for details. (You
can access the docstrings of any loaded function/variable from within
Emacs with =C-h f= for functions/commands, and =C-h v= for variables.)

Here's the default value of =orb-templates=:

#+begin_example
  (("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) ""
        :file-name "${citekey}"
        :head "#+TITLE: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}\n"
        :unnarrowed t))
#+end_example

You can modify it with =setq=. For instance, if you want to add the
cite-key in the title of the notes, you can modify the code like this
(pay attention to the line with =:head=):

#+begin_example
  (setq orb-templates
        '(("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) ""
           :file-name "${citekey}"
           :head "#+TITLE: ${citekey}: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}\n" ; <--
           :unnarrowed t)))
#+end_example

If you have more than one template in =orb-templates=, you will be
prompted for the key of the template you want to use (=r= in the example
above). If you only have one template, it will use this one without
prompting you.

** =orb-preformat-keywords=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orb-preformat-keywords
:END:
A list of template prompt wildcards for preformatting. Any BibTeX field
can be set for preformatting including =bibtex-completion='s' "virtual"
fields such as =key=' and '=type='. BibTeX fields can be refered to by
means of their aliases defined in orb-bibtex-field-aliases.

Usage example:

#+begin_example
  (setq orb-preformat-keywords '("citekey" "author" "date"))
  (setq orb-templates
        '((\"r\" \"reference\" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
           "#+ROAM_KEY: %^{citekey}%?
  %^{author} published %^{entry-type} in %^{date}: fullcite:%\\1."
           :file-name "references/${citekey}"
           :head "#+TITLE: ${title}"
           :unnarrowed t)))
#+end_example

By default, =org-preformat-keywords= is configured to expand the
following BibTeX fields: "citekey", "date", "entry-type", "pdf?",
"note?", "author", "editor", "author-abbrev", "editor-abbrev",
"author-or-editor-abbrev".

Special cases:

- The "file" keyword will be treated specially if the value of
  `orb-process-file-keyword' is non-nil. See its docstring for an
  explanation.
- The "title" keyword needs not to be set for preformatting if it is
  used only within the =:head= section of the templates.

This variable takes effect when orb-preformat-templates is set to t
(default). See also orb-edit-notes for further details.

Consult the
[[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][=bibtex-completion=]]
package for additional information about BibTeX field names.

** =orb-insert= configuration

*** =orb-insert-link-description=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orb-insert-link-description
:END:
What piece of information should be used as the link description:

- =title= - entry's title

:END:
Whether to follow a newly created link.

*** =orb-insert-generic-candidates-format=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orb-insert-generic-candidates-format
:END:
How the selection candidates should be presented when using =generic=
interface:

- =key= - only citation keys. Fast and pretty, but too little contextual
  information
- =entry= - formatted entry. More information, but not particluarly
  pretty. Consider using =helm-bibtex= or =ivy-bibtex= instead.

*** Handling long templates
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: handling-long-templates
:END:
Long templates can be placed in a separate file, with template expansion
of BibTeX fields working as usual:

#+begin_example
  (setq org-roam-capture-templates
        '(("r" "reference" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
           (file "/path/to/template.org") ; <--
           :file-name "test/${citekey}"
           :head "#+TITLE: ${title}\n"
           :unnarrowed t)))
#+end_example

Content of =path/to/template.org=:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+ROAM_KEY: %^{citekey}
,#+PROPERTY: type %^{type}
,#+ROAM_TAGS: %^{keywords}
,#+PROPERTY: authors %^{author}

In this %\2 %\4 concluded that %?

fullcite:%\1
#+end_src

You can also use a function to generate the template on the fly, see
=org-capture-templates= for details.

*** Org-noter integration. Special treatment of the "file" keyword
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-noter-integration.-special-treatment-of-the-file-keyword
:END:
If =orb-process-file-keyword= is non-nil, the "file" field will be
treated specially. If the field contains only one file name, its value
will be used for template expansion. If it contains several file names,
the user will be prompted to choose one. The file names can be filtered
based on their extensions by setting the =orb-file-field-extensions=
variable, so that only those matching the extension or extensions will
be considered for retrieval. The "file" keyword must be set for
preformatting as usual. Consult the docstrings of these variables for
additional customization options.

Below shows how this can be used to integrate with
[[https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter][org-noter]] or
[[https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave][interleave]]:

#+begin_example
  (setq orb-preformat-keywords
        '("citekey" "title" "url" "author-or-editor" "keywords" "file")
        orb-process-file-keyword t
        orb-file-field-extensions '("pdf"))

  (setq orb-templates
        '(("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
           ""
           :file-name "${citekey}"
           :head "#+TITLE: ${citekey}: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}

  - tags ::

Do not forget to escape the quotes inside the =%=-escapes form!

* ORB Note Actions - BibTeX record-related commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orb-note-actions---bibtex-record-related-commands
:END:
** Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overview
:END:
Type =M-x orb-note-actions= or bind this command to a key such as
=C-c n a= to quickly access additional commands that take the note's
BibTeX key as an input and process it to perform some useful actions.

Note actions are divided into three groups: =default=, =extra=, and
=user= set via =orb-note-actions-default=, =orb-note-actions-extra=,
=orb-note-actions-user=, respectively. There is no big conceptual
difference between the three except that the =default= note actions are
commands provided by =bibtex-completion=, =extra= note actions are extra
commands provided by =org-roam-bibtex=, and =user= note actions are left
for user customization.

** Note actions interface
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: note-actions-interface
:END:
There is a number of interfaces available for displaying the available
note actions: =default= (using =completing-read=), =ido=, =ivy=, =helm=
and =hydra=. The interface can be set via the
=orb-note-actions-interface= user variable.

#+begin_example
  (setq orb-note-actions-interface 'hydra)
#+end_example

Alternatively, =orb-note-actions-interface= can be set to a custom
function that will provide completion for available note actions. The
function must take one argument CITEKEY, which is a list whose =car= is
the current note's citation key:

#+begin_example
  (setq orb-note-actions-interface #'my-orb-note-actions-interface)
#+end_example

#+begin_src org
  ,#+ROAM_KEY: cite:Doe2020
#+end_src

#+begin_example
  (defun my-orb-note-actions-interface (citekey)
    ;;; For the above note, (car citekey) => "Doe2020"
    ...)
#+end_example

** Adding new note actions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adding-new-note-actions
:END:
To install a note action, add a cons cell of format
=(DESCRIPTION . FUNCTION)= to one of the note actions variables:

#+begin_example
  (with-eval-after-load 'orb-note-actions
    (add-to-list 'orb-note-actions-user (cons "My note action" #'my-note-action)))
#+end_example

A note action must take a single argument CITEKEY, which is a list whose
car is the current note's citation key:

#+begin_example
  (defun my-note-action (citekey)
    (let ((key (car citekey)))
      ...))
#+end_example

* ORB PDF Scrapper - Retrieve references from PDFs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orb-pdf-scrapper---retrieve-references-from-pdfs
:END:
** Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overview-1
:END:
ORB PDF Scrapper is an Emacs interface to
[[https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle][=anystyle=]], an open-source
software based on powerful machine-learning algorithms. It requires
=anystyle-cli=, which can be installed with
=[sudo] gem install anystyle-cli=. Note that =ruby= and =gem= must
already be present in the system. =ruby= is shipped with MacOS, but you
will have to install it on other operating systems; please refer to the
relevant section in the official documentation for =ruby=. You may also
want to consult the [[https://rubydoc.info/gems/anystyle][=anystyle=
documentation]] to learn more about how it works.

Once =anystyle-cli= is installed, ORB PDF Scrapper can be launched with
=orb-note-actions= while in an Org-roam buffer containing a
=#+ROAM_KEY:= BibTeX key. References are retrieved from a PDF file
associated with the note which is retrieved from the corresponding
BibTeX record.

The reference-retrieval process consists of three interactive steps
described below.

** Text mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: text-mode
:END:
In the first step, the PDF file is searched for references, which are
eventually output in the ORB PDF Scrapper buffer as plain text. The
buffer is in the =text-mode= major-mode for editing general text files.

You need to review the retrieved references and prepare them for the
next step in such a way that there is only one reference per line. You
may also need to remove any extra text captured together with the
references. Some PDF files will produce a nicely-formed list of
references that will require little to no manual editing, while others
will need a different degree of manual intervention.

Generally, it is possible to train a custom =anystyle= finder model
responsible for PDF-parsing to improve the output quality, but this is
not currently supported by ORB PDF Scrapper. As a small and somewhat
naïve aid, the =sanitize text= command bound to =C-c C-u= may assist in
putting each reference onto a separate line.

After you are finished with editing the text data, press =C-c C-c= to
proceed to the second step.

Press =C-x C-s= to save your progress or =C-x C-w= to write the text
references into a file.

Press =C-c C-k= anytime to abort the ORB PDF Scrapper process.

** BibTeX mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: bibtex-mode
:END:
In the second step, the obtained list of plain text references, one
reference per line, is parsed and converted into BibTeX format. The
resulting BibTeX records are presented to the user in the ORB PDF
Scrapper buffer replacing the text references. The buffer's major mode
switches to =bibtex-mode=, which is helpful for reviewing and editing
the BibTeX data and correcting possible parsing errors.

Again, depending on the citation style used in the particular book or
article, the parsing quality can vary greatly and might require more or
less manual post-editing. It is possible to train a custom =anystyle=
parser model to improve the parsing quality. See
[[#training-a-parser-model][Training a Parser model]] for more details.

Press =C-c C-u= to generate BibTeX keys for the records in the buffer or
=C-u C-c C-u= to generate a key for the record at point. See
[[#orb-autokey-configuration][ORB Autokey configuration]] on how to
configure the BibTeX key generation. During key generation, it is also
possible to automatically set the values of BibTeX fields: see
=orb-pdf-scrapper-set-fields= docstring for more details.

Press =C-x C-s= to save your progress or =C-x C-w= to write the BibTeX
entries into a file.

Press =C-c C-r= to return to the text-editing mode in its last state.
Note that all the progress in BibTeX mode will be lost.

Press =C-c C-c= to proceed to the third step. If the BibTeX buffer was
edited and the changes were not saved, e.g. by pressing =C-x C-s=, you
will be prompted to generated BibTeX keys by default. The variable
=orb-pdf-prompt-to-generate-keys= more finely controls this behaviour.

** Org mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: org-mode
:END:
In the third step, the BibTeX records are processed internally by ORB
PDF Scrapper, and the result replaces the BibTeX data in the ORB PDF
Scrapper, which switches to =org-mode=.

The processing involves sorting the references into four groups under
the respective Org-mode headlines: =in-roam=, =in-bib=, =valid=, and
=invalid=, and inserting the grouped references as either an Org-mode
plain-list of =org-ref=-style citations, or an Org-mode table with
columns corresponding to different BibTeX fields.

- =in-roam= --- These references have notes with the respective
  =#+ROAM_KEY:= citation keys in the =org-roam= database.
- =in-bib= --- These references are not yet in the =org-roam= database
  but they are present in user BibTeX file(s) (see
  =bibtex-completion-bibliography=).
- =invalid= --- These references matched against
  =orb-pdf-scrapper-invalid-key-pattern= and are considered invalid.
  Adjust this variable to your criteria of validity.
- =valid= --- All other references fall into this group. They look fine
  but are not yet in user Org-roam and BibTeX databases.

Set =orb-pdf-scrapper-group-references= to nil if you do not need
reference grouping.

Review and edit the generated Org-mode data, or press =C-c C-c= to
insert the references into the note's buffer and finish the ORB PDF
Scrapper.

Press =C-x C-s= to save your progress or =C-x C-w= to write the Org data
into a file.

Press =C-c C-r= to return to BibTeX editing mode in its last state. Note
that all the progress in current mode will be lost.

The following user variables control the appearance of the generated
Org-mode data: =orb-pdf-scrapper-group-references=,
=orb-pdf-scrapper-grouped-export=, =orb-pdf-scrapper-ungrouped-export=,
=orb-pdf-scrapper-table-export-fields=, =orb-pdf-scrapper-list-style=,
=orb-pdf-scrapper-reference-numbers=, =orb-pdf-scrapper-citekey-format=.
These variables can be set through the Customize interface or with
=setq=. Refer to their respective docstrings in Emacs for more
information.

** Exporting data generated by ORB PDF Scrapper
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: exporting-data-generated-by-orb-pdf-scrapper
:END:
The different types of data generated by ORB PDF Scrapper -- text,
BibTeX and Org - can be exported to the buffer of origin or an external
file. By default, only the Org data is exported to the buffer of origin.
Different export options can be set in
=orb-pdf-scrapper-export-options=. Consult its docstring for a detailed
explanation. The following example demonstrates various possibilities.

** Training a Parser model
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: training-a-parser-model
:END:
*** Prerequisites
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: prerequisites
:END:
Currently, the core data set (explained below) must be installed
manually by the user as follows:

1. Use =find=, =locate= or similar tools to find the file =core.xml=
   buried in =res/parser/= subdirectory of =anystyle= gem,
   e.g. =locate core.xml | grep    anystyle=. On MacOS, with =anystyle=
   installed as a system gem, the file path would look similar to:

   ="/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.6.0/gems/anystyle-1.3.11/res/parser/core.xml"=

   The actual path will vary slightly depending on the
   currently-installed versions of =ruby= and =anystyle=.

   On Linux and Windows, this path will be different.

2. Copy this file into the location specified in
   =orb-anystyle-parser-training-set=, or anywhere else where you have
   disk-write access, and adjust the aforementioned variable
   accordingly.

*** Running a training session
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: running-a-training-session
:END:
Training a custom parser model on custom user data will greatly improve
the parsing of plain-text references. A training session can be
initiated by pressing =C-c C-t= in the ORB PDF Scrapper buffer in either
text-mode or BibTeX-mode. In each case, the plain-text references
obtained in the =text mode= step described above will be used to
generate source XML data for a training set.

The generated XML data replaces the text or the BibTeX references in the
ORB PDF Scrapper buffer, and the major-mode switches to =xml-mode=.

The XML data must be edited manually---this is the whole point of
creating a custom training model---which usually consists in simply
correcting the placement of bibliographic data within the XML elements
(data fields). It is extremely important to review the source data
carefully since any mistakes here will make its way into the model,
thereby leading to poorer parsing in the future.

It would be quite tedious to create the whole data-set by hand---
hundreds or thousands of individual bibliographic records---so the best
workflow for making a good custom data-set is to use the core data-set
shipped with =anystyle= and append to it several data-sets generated in
ORB PDF Scrapper training sessions from individual PDF files,
incrementally re-training the model in between. This approach is
implemented in ORB PDF Scrapper. From personal experience, adding
references data incrementally from 4--5 PDF files raises the parser
success rate to virtually 100%. Follow the instructions described in
[[#parser-model-prerequisites][Prerequisites]] to install the core
data-set.

Once the editing is done, press =C-c C-c= to train the model. The XML
data in the ORB PDF Scrapper buffer will be automatically appended to
the custom =core.xml= file which will be used for training.
Alternatively, press =C-c C-t= to review the updated =core.xml= file and
press =C-c C-c= when finished.

The major mode will now switch to =fundamental-mode=, and the =anystyle=
=stdout= output will appear in the buffer. Training the model can take
/several minutes/, depending on the size of the training data-set and
the computing resources available on your device. The process is run in
a shell subprocess, so you will be able to continue your work and return
to ORB PDF Scrapper buffer later.

Once the training is complete, press =C-c C-c= to return to the previous
editing-mode. You can now re-generate the BibTeX data and see the
improvements achieved with the re-trained model.

=N= and =M= should be a single digit =1-9=. Putting more digits or any
other symbols will lead to ignoring the optional parameter and those
following it altogether. =D= should be a single alphanumeric symbol or
one of =-_.:|=.

Optional parameters work both with capitalized and starred versions
where applicable.

#+begin_example
  (setq orb-autokey-format "%A*[1][4][-]%y") => "DoeJ2020"
  (setq orb-autokey-format "%A*[2][7][-]:%y") => "DoeJohn-DoeJane:2020"
#+end_example

4. Elisp expression

- can be anything
- should return a string or nil
- will be evaluated before expanding other wildcards and therefore can
  be used to insert other wildcards
- will have entry variable bound to the value of BibTeX entry the key is
  being generated for, as returned by bibtex-completion-get-entry. The
  variable may be safely manipulated in a destructive manner.

#+begin_example
  %e{(or (bibtex-completion-get-value "volume" entry) "N/A")} 
  %e{(my-function entry)}
#+end_example

* Orb Anystyle - Emacs interfeace to Anystyle-CLI
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orb-anystyle
:END:
The function =orb-anystyle= provides a convenient Elisp key--value
interface to =anystyle-cli=, and can be used anywhere else within Emacs.
Check its docstring for more information. You may also want to consult
[[https://rubydoc.info/gems/anystyle][=anystyle-cli= documentation]].

** Example

This Elisp expression:

#+begin_example
  (orb-anystyle 'parse
                :format 'bib
                :stdout nil
                :overwrite t
                :input "Doe2020.txt "
                :output "bib"
                :parser-model "/my/custom/model.mod")
#+end_example

...executes the following anystyle call:

#+begin_example
  anystyle --no-stdout --overwrite -F "/my/custom/model.mod" -f bib parse "Doe2020.txt" "bib"
#+end_example
