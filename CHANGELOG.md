- Save citekey note action

### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2014-05-03
### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2020-05-03
### Added
- New feature: note actions. A single interactive dispatcher command
  to perform useful commands in the notes buffer. The command displays
  a predefined set of actions using one of: Emacs default
  `completing-read`, Emacs built-in `ido`, third-party `helm`, `ivy`
  or `hydra` interfaces. User note actions can be installed.

### Changed 
- The package's namespace `org-roam-bibtex` was abbreviated to
  `orb`. The old namespace is retained only for the variables and
  functions matching `.+-mode.*` names.

### Deprecated
- `org-roam-bibtex` namespace

## [0.1.0] - 2020-04-26
### Added
- And so the journey begins...
- Meaning that it looks like a package, behaves like a package and is
  packaged like a package! On [MELPA].
- The package is meant to connect [org-roam] (note management) and
  [helm-bibtex/bibtex-completion] (bibtex management).
- Expand org-roam-capture-templates using bibtex-completion as a
  backend for retrieving bibliographic information associated with
  #+ROAM_KEY:, which is supposed to be a valid citation key in a
  bibtex file.
- org-roam-bibtex-mode: a minor mode that performs initial setup
- Filter function for org-roam-find-file to retrieve non-bibliographic
  notes (those that do not have #+ROAM_KEY:) and interactive user
  functions to use the filter.
- Find note function for bibtex-completion 
- Find note function for org-ref
- A few more things 
- And an excellent documentation!
