Description
---------------

`org-roam-bibtex` is a library which offers a tighter integration between [`org-roam`](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam), [`helm-bibtex`](https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex), and [`org-ref`](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref).

It allows users to access their bibliographical notes in `org-roam-directory` via `helm-bibtex`, `ivy-bibtex`, or by opening `org-ref`â€™s `cite:` links and running `3. Add notes`.  If the note does not exist, it is created.

A word of warning ðŸš§
---------------

`org-roam-bibtex` is in **Alpha**.

This means that a lot of things may change in the future (e.g. renaming variables, rewriting functions).  As a result, the package will be unstable for a while.  This will change when we release v1.0, but for now, you will have to be on the lookout for a few things:
1. If you encounter a problem with the package, start by making sure that you have the latest version. (cf. [Installation](#installation))
2. If there is a problem with your configuration, most notably variables which do not exist anymore or functions which are not called with the right number of arguments, you will need to check this page to see what has changed.
3. If neither 1. nor 2. resolved your problem, please open an **issue**.  (This is what an Alpha version is for!)

##### WARNING! 

- **In version 0.2, the `org-roam-bibtex` namespace was renamed to `orb`, except for `org-roam-bibtex-mode` and other definitions that match the `*-mode*` pattern. The existing functions and variables bearing the old prefix will be supported for a while but support will be dropped eventually. All new functions and variables will have the new prefix except those matching the `*-mode*` pattern, which will retain the `org-roam-bibtex` namespace.**

Installation
---------------

### Via MELPA

The package is on [MELPA](https://github.com/melpa/melpa).  You can install `org-roam-bibtex` using `package.el`:
```
M-x package-install RET org-roam-bibtex RET
```

You can also install it with `M-x package-list-packages`.

If you do not know how MELPA works, check their [Usage](https://github.com/melpa/melpa#usage) section.

### Via cloning

You can also clone the repository somewhere in your `load-path`.  If you would like to assist with development, this is the way to go.

To do that:
1. Create a directory where youâ€™d like to clone the repository, e.g. `mkdir ~/projects`.
2. `cd ~/projects`
3. `git clone https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex.git`

You now have the repository cloned in `~/projects/org-roam-bibtex/`.  See [Quick-start](#quick-start-) to learn how to add it to your `load-path` and to get started with the package.

(You can also copy [`org-roam-bibtex.el`](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex/blob/improve-readme/org-roam-bibtex.el) somewhere where `load-path` can access it, but youâ€™d have to update the file manually.)

### Spacemacs

Assuming `org-roam` is installed via a private layer as described in [here](https://org-roam.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation/#spacemacs),
add `org-roam-bibtex` to `org-roam-packages:

``` el
(defconst org-roam-packages
  '(org-roam **org-roam-bibtex**))

```

and this after `org-roam/init-org-roam`:

``` el
(defun org-roam/init-org-roam-bibtex ()
  (use-package org-roam-bibtex
    :after org-roam
    :hook (org-roam-mode . org-roam-bibtex-mode)
    :bind (:map org-mode-map
          (("C-c n a" . orb-note-actions)))))
```

### Doom Emacs

Put this in `$DOOMDIR/packages.el`:

```el
(package! org-roam-bibtex
  :recipe (:host github :repo "org-roam/org-roam-bibtex"))

;; When using org-roam via the `+roam` flag
(unpin! org-roam company-org-roam)

;; When using bibtex-completion via the `biblio` module
(unpin! bibtex-completion helm-bibtex ivy-bibtex)
```
Then run `bin/doom sync`. The package can be configured with `use-package` (or alternatively `Doom`'s `use-package!`) as described below.

Quick-start ðŸš€
---------------

You can get `org-roam-bibtex` up and running by pasting the following sexps in your [init-file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html):

### With `use-package`

```el
;; If you installed via MELPA
(use-package org-roam-bibtex
  :after org-roam
  :hook (org-roam-mode . org-roam-bibtex-mode)
  :bind (:map org-mode-map
         (("C-c n a" . orb-note-actions))))

;; If you cloned the repository
(use-package org-roam-bibtex
  :after org-roam
  :load-path "~/projects/org-roam-bibtex/" ;Modify with your own path
  :hook (org-roam-mode . org-roam-bibtex-mode)
  :bind (:map org-mode-map
         (("C-c n a" . orb-note-actions))))
```

### Without `use-package`

```el
;; If you installed via MELPA
(require 'org-roam-bibtex)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'org-roam-bibtex-mode)
(define-key org-roam-bibtex-mode-map (kbd "C-c n a") #'orb-note-actions)

;; If you cloned the repository
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/org-roam-bibtex/") ;Modify with your own path
(require 'org-roam-bibtex)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'org-roam-bibtex-mode)
(define-key org-roam-bibtex-mode-map (kbd "C-c n a") #'orb-note-actions)
```

Usage
---------------

You can now access your bibliographical notes in your `org-roam-directory` via `helm-bibtex`/`ivy-bibtex` or by opening `org-ref` links.  This is done in the background by modifying the `Edit notes` actions used by these packages to use `orb-edit-notes` instead of their defaults.

To revert those actions to their defaults, disable `org-roam-bibtex-mode`.

### Commands

#### `orb-find-non-ref-file`

Similar to `org-roam-find-file`, but it excludes your bibliographical notes from the completion-candidates.  This is useful if you have a lot of them and do not want to clutter up your other notes.

#### `orb-insert-non-ref`

Similar to `org-roam-insert`, but it excludes your bibliographical notes from the completion-list.

Configuration
---------------

### Variables

#### `orb-templates`

This variable specifies the templates to use when creating a new bibliographical note.  It builds on the syntax of `org-roam-capture-templates` by allowing you to expand predefined variables to the value of a BibTeX fields.

See `orb-edit-notes` and [`orb-preformat-keywords`](#orb-preformat-keywords) for details.  (You can access the docstrings of any loaded function/variable from within Emacs with `C-h f` for functions/commands, and `C-h v` for variables.)

Hereâ€™s the default value of `orb-templates`:
```el
(("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) ""
      :file-name "${citekey}"
      :head "#+TITLE: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}\n"
      :unnarrowed t))
```

You can modify it with `setq`.  For instance, if you want to add the cite-key in the title of the notes, you can modify the code like this (pay attention to the line with `:head`):
```el
(setq orb-templates
      '(("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point) ""
         :file-name "${citekey}"
         :head "#+TITLE: ${citekey}: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}\n" ; <--
         :unnarrowed t)))
```

If you have more than one template in `orb-templates`, you will be prompted for the key of the template you want to use (`r` in the example above).  If you only have one template, it will use this one without prompting you.

See [Modifying templates](#modifying-templates) for more info.

#### `orb-preformat-keywords`

The template prompt wildcards for preformatting.  Only relevant when `orb-preformat-templates` is set to `t` (default).  This can be a string, a list of strings or a cons-cell alist, where each element is `(STRING . STRING)`.

Use only alphanumerical characters, dash and underscore. See `orb-edit-notes` for implementation details.

1. If the value is a string, a single keyword, it is treated as a BibTeX field name, such as `=key=`. In the following example all the prompts with the `=key=` keyword will be preformatted, as well as the corresponding match group `%\1`.

```el
(setq orb-preformat-keywords "=key=")
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      â€™(("r" "reference" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
         "#+ROAM_KEY: %^{=key=}%? fullcite: %\1"
         :file-name "references/${=key=}"
         :head "#+TITLE: ${title}"
         :unnarrowed t)))
```

2. If the value is a list of strings they are also treated as BibTeX field names. The respective prompts will be preformatted.

```el
(setq orb-preformat-keywords â€™("=key=" "title"))
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      â€™(("r" "reference" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
         "#+ROAM_KEY: %^{=key=}%? fullcite: %\1"
         :file-name "references/${=key=}"
         :head "#+TITLE: ${title}"
         :unnarrowed t)))
```

3. If the value is a list of cons cells, then the car of the cons cell is treated as a prompt keyword and the cdr as a BibTeX field-name, and the latter will be used to retrieve the relevant value from the BibTeX entry. If cdr is omitted, then the car is treated as the field-name.

```el
(setq orb-preformat-keywords
      '(("citekey" . "=key=")
        ("type" . "=type=")
       "title"))
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("r" "reference" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
         "#+ROAM_KEY: %^{citekey}%? fullcite: %\1
          #+TAGS: %^{type}
          This %\2 deals with ..."
         :file-name "references/%<%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S>_${title}"
         :head "#+TITLE: ${title}"
         :unnarrowed t)))
```

Note that, by default, `org-preformat-keywords` is only configured to replace `${citekey}` with the value of `=key=`:

```el
(setq orb-preformat-keywords
      '(("citekey" . "=key=")))
```

Consult the [`helm-bibtex`](https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex) package for additional information about BibTeX field names.

### Modifying templates

#### Handling long templates

If your template is long, you can also place the template inside a file (with the same expansion of BibTeX fields):
```el
(setq org-roam-capture-templates
      '(("r" "reference" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
         (file "/path/to/template.org") ; <--
         :file-name "test/${citekey}"
         :head "#+TITLE: ${title}\n"
         :unnarrowed t)))
```

Content of `path/to/template.org`:
```org
#+ROAM_KEY: %^{citekey}
#+PROPERTY: type %^{type}
#+TAGS: %^{keywords}
#+PROPERTY: authors %^{author}

In this %\2 %\4 concluded that %?

fullcite:%\1
```

You can also use a function to generate the the template if you need something more advanced.  

#### `%(orb-process-file-field \"${=key=}\")`

The convenience-function `orb-process-file-field` has been added to find documents associated with the BibTeX entry.  It is intended to be used inside your template via a `%`-escapes form for sexp (`%(sexp)`).  See `org-capture-templates` for details.

Below shows how this can be used to integrate with [org-noter](https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter) or [interleave](https://github.com/rudolfochrist/interleave):

```el
(setq orb-preformat-keywords
   '(("citekey" . "=key=") "title" "url" "file" "author-or-editor" "keywords"))

(setq orb-templates
      '(("r" "ref" plain (function org-roam-capture--get-point)
         ""
         :file-name "${citekey}"
         :head "#+TITLE: ${citekey}: ${title}\n#+ROAM_KEY: ${ref}

- tags ::
- keywords :: ${keywords}

* ${title}
:PROPERTIES:
:Custom_ID: ${citekey}
:URL: ${url}
:AUTHOR: ${author-or-editor}
:NOTER_DOCUMENT: %(orb-process-file-field \"${citekey}\")
:NOTER_PAGE:
:END:")))
```

Do not forget to escape the quotes inside the `%`-escapes form!
