Description
---------------

Org Roam BibTeX (ORB) is an Org Roam extension that integrates [Org
Roam](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam) with [Helm and Ivy
BibTeX](https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex) and [Org
Ref](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref).

It allows users to manage their bibliographical notes using Org Roam and access
the notes in `org-roam-directory` via `helm-bibtex`, `ivy-bibtex`, or by
opening `org-ref`â€™s `cite:` links.

Important news 
---------------------------------

Org Roam BibTeX v0.5.1 is the last version of ORB that works with Org-roam v1.
Future releases of ORB starting with v0.6 will work only with Org-roam v2 and
will not be backwards compatible with ORB < v0.6.  There will be no deprecation
notices on functions and variables!

The yet unreleased version compatible with Org-roam v2 can be found on the
`org-roam-v2` branch for testing and early adoption.  ~~It will be eventually
merged into `master`.~~

**Org Roam BibTeX will be upgraded to v0.6 on the upcoming Saturday, July 3rd,
2021, 00:00 CEST, following (or preceding?) the Org-roam upgrade to v2! Once
again, on Friday the 2nd of July at 23:00 in London, and at 6 pm in New York as
well as on Saturday, July 3rd, at 6 am in Hong Kong and at 7 am in Tokyo, ORB
will be upgraded to v0.6, which is uncompatible with current v0.5.1
configuration.**

A word of warning ðŸš§
---------------

`org-roam-bibtex` is in **Alpha**.

This means that a lot of things may change in the future (e.g. renaming
variables, rewriting functions).  As a result, the package will be unstable for
a while.  This will change when we release v1.0, but for now, you will have to
be on the lookout for a few things:

1. If you encounter a problem with the package, start by making sure that you
   have the latest version. (cf. [Installation](#installation))
2. If there is a problem with your configuration, most notably variables which
   do not exist anymore or functions which are not called with the right number
   of arguments, you will need to check this page to see what has changed.
3. If neither 1. nor 2. resolved your problem, read the following section on
   [how to get help](#orb-help-me).

<a name="orb-help-me"></a>Getting help
---------------

Please read carefully this section before installing Org Roam BibTeX.  We are
glad to help you in case something does not work as expected.  However, we
kindly ask you to follow these simple rules when asking for help:

1. Read carefully this README file.
2. Read it once again, please.  Consult the [extended manual](doc/orb-manual.org)
3. Check our [community resources](#community) and describe your problem there.
4. Open an issue on the bug tracker.
5. Take your time to describe your problem and we'll take ours to help you solve it.
6. Describe your problem clearly, in a procedural way: "I run `this command`,
then I run `that command`, and finally `this one`.  I expect `this` to happen
but instead happens `that`.  Here is my `configuration`."
7. Thank you!

Keep in mind that ORB is under active development and the configuration
snippets that you might have found somewhere in the Internet may be outdated
and be the actual cause your errors.  It is therefore highly recommended to use
this README file, [the manual](doc/orb-manual.org) and the Emacs built-in
docstrings as primary documentation sources.

Installation
---------------

### Hard dependencies

Org Roam BibTeX depends on [Org Roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam),
[BibTeX Completion](https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex), and [Org
Ref](https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref).  Users cloning ORB directly from
GitHub also need to install the above packages and to ensure that
`bibtex-completion` is autoloaded.  When installing ORB with a package manager
(MELPA) or from within a configuration framework (Doom, Spacemacs), no
additional steps are required.

Org Roam BibTeX deliberately does not load Org Ref and delegates this tasks to
the user.  However, this package _must_ be loaded before running any Org Roam
BibTeX-related commands.  See below for examples.

### Soft dependencies

Some parts of Org Roam BibTeX will not work without: 

* [AnyStyle CLI](https://github.com/inukshuk/anystyle-cli) â€” ORB PDF Scrapper
requires this external tool, see [Orb Anystyle](#orb-anystyle) for more
details.

* ORB offers basic completion functions based on Emacs native completion
  interfaces, but user experience can be enhanced with Helm, Ivy and Hydra
  packages.
* Users of Projectile and Persp-mode will be pleased to learn that ORB can
  automatically switch perspective to the Org Roam project when creating a
  note.

### With Emacs built-in package manager (`package.el`)

The package is on [MELPA](https://github.com/melpa/melpa).

1. Install `org-roam-bibtex`:

    a) using `package.el`:

    ```
    M-x package-install RET org-roam-bibtex RET
    ```

    b) Alternatively, install it with `M-x package-list-packages`.

2. Load and configure the package in your
[init-file](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Init-File.html):

    a) with `use-package`:

    ``` emacs-lisp
    (use-package org-roam-bibtex
      :after org-roam
      :config
      (require 'org-ref)) ; optional: if Org Ref is not loaded anywhere else, load it here
    ```

    b) Alternatively, require the package if you don't use `use-package`:

    ``` emacs-lisp
    (require 'org-ref) ; optional: if Org Ref is not loaded anywhere else, load it here
    (require 'org-roam-bibtex)
    ```

### Via cloning

You can also clone the repository somewhere in your `load-path`.  If you would
like to assist with development, this is the way to go.

To do that:

1. Create a directory where youâ€™d like to clone the repository, e.g. `mkdir
   ~/projects`.

2. `cd ~/projects`

3. `git clone https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex.git`

4. Load and configure the package:

    a) with `use-package`:

    ```emacs-lisp
    (use-package org-roam-bibtex
      :after org-roam
      :load-path "~/projects/org-roam-bibtex/" ; Modify with your own path where you cloned the repository
      :config
      (require 'org-ref)) ; optional: if Org Ref is not loaded anywhere else, load it here
    ```

    b) Alternatively, if you don't use `use-package`: 

    ```emacs-lisp
    (require 'org-ref) ; optional: if Org Ref is not loaded anywhere else, load it here
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/projects/org-roam-bibtex/") ; Modify with your own path where you cloned the repository
    (require 'org-roam-bibtex)
    ```

### Spacemacs

If you have a private `org-roam` layer, modify it as follows:

``` emacs-lisp
(defconst org-roam-packages
  '(org-roam org-roam-bibtex))

 ;; add this after `org-roam/init-org-roam`:

(defun org-roam/init-org-roam-bibtex ()
  (use-package org-roam-bibtex
    :after org-roam
    :config
    (require 'org-ref)) ; optional: if Org Ref is not loaded anywhere else, load it here
```

If you don't have a private `org-roam` layer, configure it first, see examples
[here](https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/orb-helm-bibtex-open-notes-wont-create-new-note/690)
and
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f6erh0/total_noob_how_do_i_install_orgroam_in_spacemacs/).

Recent versions of Spacemacs ship with a built-in `org-roam` support, so you
won't need a private `org-roam` layer.  You still need a private layer for
`org-roam-bibtex`.  Consult Spacemacs documentation on how to create one, or
use the approach described in the above mentioned resources.

### Doom Emacs

1. Put this in `$DOOMDIR/packages.el`:

``` emacs-lisp
(package! org-roam-bibtex
  :recipe (:host github :repo "org-roam/org-roam-bibtex"))

;; When using org-roam via the `+roam` flag
(unpin! org-roam)

;; When using bibtex-completion via the `biblio` module
(unpin! bibtex-completion helm-bibtex ivy-bibtex)
```

2. Put this in `$DOOMDIR/config.el`: 

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package! org-roam-bibtex
  :after org-roam
  :config
  (require 'org-ref)) ; optional: if Org Ref is not loaded anywhere else, load it here
```

3. Run `bin/doom sync` and restart Emacs.

Usage
---------------

#### `org-roam-bibtex-mode`

Call interactively `org-roam-bibtex-mode` or arrange your init file to perform
this automatically.

You can now access your bibliographical notes in `org-roam-directory` with
`helm-bibtex`/`ivy-bibtex` or by opening `org-ref` links.  ORB modifies the
behaviour of the above packages to make them use `orb-edit-note` instead of
their default note-management commands.  To get their default behaviour back,
disable `org-roam-bibtex-mode`.

#### `orb-note-actions`

Type `M-x orb-note-actions` to easily access additional commands useful in
note's context.  These commands are run with the note's BibTeX key as an
argument. The key is taken from the `:ROAM_REFS:` file or heading property.

#### `orb-insert-link`

Select a bibliography entry and insert a link to a note associated with it.  If
the note does not exist yet, create it.  Similar to `org-roam-node-insert`, if a
region is selected, it becomes the link description.

Configuration
---------------

See [the Org Roam BibTeX Manual](doc/orb-manual.org) for configuration options and
advanced usage.
