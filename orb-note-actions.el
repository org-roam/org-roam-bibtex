;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library offers a way to run actions associated with the note
;; file the current buffer is visiting, such as locate the
;; corresponding bibtex record or open a PDF file associated with it.
;;
;; To use it:
;;
;; call interactively `org-roam-bibtex-note-actions' from a notes buffer
;; containing the #+ROAM_KEY: keyword.
;;
;; Default actions are driven by bibtex-completion but users can install
;; their own actions in `org-roam-bibtex-note-actions'.

Alternatively, it can be set to a function, in which case the
function should expect one argument CITEKEY, which is a list
whose car is the citation key associated with the org-roam note
the current buffer is visiting.  Also, it should ideally make use
of `orb-note-actions-default', `orb-note-actions-extra' and
`orb-note-actions-user' for providing an interactive interface,
through which the combined set of note actions is presented as a
list of candidates and the function associated with the candidate
is executed upon selecting it."
